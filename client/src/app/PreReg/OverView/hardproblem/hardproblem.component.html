            <p>Hunter solves problems so vast that normal computer search methods canâ€™t find
              an solution in a reasonable time - or maybe ever.</p>
            <p>
              For example:
            <ul>
              <li> Medical: A better material replacement for knee cartiledge, Material
                Science (Physics), BioChemical, BioMedical, and others.</li>
              <li> Other BioMedical areas such as Stem Cell Research, Cancer, or Viruses. </li>
              <li> Multi-part problems: first find a physical solution
                then determine how to manufacture it.  
                Hunter's "State-Machine Techniques" allow this.
              </li>
              <li> Other areas from the common cold, flu, HIV, heart disease,  
                Parkinson's, and degenerative aging.
              </li>
              <li> Long-term Weather prediction. A lot of work has gone into improving weather
                prediction over the years; it still has room for improvement.
              </li>
              <li> Improving crop production.</li>
              <li> Creating educational applications that adapt to the abilities and 
                characteristics of the student.
              </li>
            </ul>
